                <h1>02. When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb.</h1>
            <h2 className='text-center'>Use of Node JS</h2>
            <h5>Backend for social media networking</h5>
            <p>Many renowned names such as LinkedIn and Medium are rebuilt on Node.js. An essential combination of nodes is needed to build a backend for a social media networking site. Node.js provides blazing-fast routing with its V8 engine along with secure authentication. Scalability is one of the most significant factors which enriches a social media network.</p>
            <h5>Single-page application</h5>
            <p>Like single-page websites, Node.js can build a single-page app, where the look and feel are similar to a desktop application. Due to its versatile options, Node.js is a good fit for building social networking platforms, dynamic websites, and mailing solutions. What’s more, the asynchronous data flow quality on the backend in Node.js makes it the best bet for SPA development.</p>
            <h5>Chat application</h5>
            <p>Node.js offers exclusive advanced functionalities for real-time chatbots and chat applications. The key features such as multi-user applications, intensive data, heavy traffic across all devices are very popular in chatbots. Node.js hits the sweet spot, for it runs across different devices and covers all paradigms in chat and chatbot apps. In addition, Node.js makes it easy to execute push notifications and server-side event loops popular in IMs and real-time apps.</p>
            <h2 className='text-center'>Use of Mongodb</h2>
            <p>MongoDB facilitate to store database in json(javascript object notation) (or simply when data in form of key value pair) this is very fast and efficient so you should use it when you have key value pair to store(json data) one of the best advantage with MongoDB is you can store a collection inside another collection (in relational database is can be said as table inside another table) this neglect use of “join” You can also store a array inside a field (neglect use of foreign key of relational model) in this you can use concepts like mongo population to join data of multipal fields if require and most importantly it support More user at a time and also useful if you have large number of fields ( large number of coloums in your collection or table)</p>
